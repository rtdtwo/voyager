# Libraries in use:
- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) using which Voyager is built.
- [React Leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet) allowing easy access to the powerful [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) mapping library.
- [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) which made UI building hassle-free.
- [Turfjs Bezier Spline](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) which makes drawing airplane paths easy.
- [React Context Hook](https://github.com/Spyna/react-context-hook) for effortless global state management.

# Data storage
The web app has no data transfer involved whatsoever, except for loading the map data when you're moving and zooming around. This is achieved by storing data in the browser's local storage. Hence, clearing browser data will result in all data to be permanently erased. So, tread cautiously. A backup and restore feature will be implemented soon.

# Credits
- ***Anushka Ramteke***, for the endless travel talks and our collective love to travel that inspired me to make this! She's also the person to credit for the color schemes used here.
- ***[Akash Joshi](https://github.com/akash-joshi)***, for inardavently  introducing me to React. His React articles have been a lot of help too!
- ***[Varun Joshi](https://github.com/joshvarun)***, who said *"Hey, why don't you try Chakra UI?"* on a call. He's also a close friend and a well wisher!
- ***My beloved late father***, for gifting me an atlas when I was 6 years old, something that led me to develop an obsession towards geography and cartography.

# Homage
Although this tool is in no way related to space exploration, the tool is named after *Voyager 1*, the cosmic traveler.
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Voyager_spacecraft_model.png/320px-Voyager_spacecraft_model.png)

*Voyager 1* is the farthest man-made object from Earth. The spacecraft, now more than *22 billion km (14 billion miles)* away from us, is slated to wander the vast darkness of space for eternity. 

By 2025, its radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs, a type of nuclear power generator) will no longer supply enough electric power for onboard instruments, and it will disappear from our sight forever. However, it carries a gold-plated audio-visual disc, should the spacecraft ever be found by intelligent life forms from other planetary systems. 

Quite indeed, it is boldly going where no one has ever gone before!üññ
